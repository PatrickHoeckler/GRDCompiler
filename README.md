# GRDCompiler

This repository contains my assignement for the final project in the construction of compilers class.

![Finite State Machine for the language](GRDlexer/docs/automato.png)
<p align="center"><em>Finite State Machine used by the lexer</em></p>

This is an incomplete compiler, it contains the lexer and parser programs but is missing the semantic analysis and the generation of a compiled output. However the functional parts work very well and they give a good basis for understanding how one would go about programming a compiler and the challenges involved in the task.

The language for this compiler was chosen by the teacher, it is a simplified fictional language, containing enough detail to be studied in the semester but without all the complexity of modern languages.

## Documentation
For a complete description about the language, you can check the [manual](docs/manual-linguagem.pdf) (Portuguese only).
And [here](docs/grammar.xlsx) you can find the complete grammar of the language, it's rules and it's parse table.

For details about each program, you can access the [Lexer](GRDlexer) and [Parser](GRDparser) pages.
